                <h2 class="mb-4">History of RDA</h2>
                <p>The historical development of the road network in the country dates back to Colonial times when roads
                  were constructed mainly to transport agricultural produce such as Tea and Coffee from plantation areas
                  to the Colombo harbour and for Civil Administration and defence. The roads initially constructed in
                  the
                  country catered for animal drawn carts. With the advent of the motor vehicles in the country in the
                  1940s, it became necessary to improve the road network to cater for the needs of the motor vehicles.
                  <br><br>

                  In the 1950s the main road network of the country was developed and maintained by the Public Works
                  Department. This department was responsible not only for Roads but also for Buildings, Water Supply &
                  Drainage, Housing etc. In the mid 1960s the Public Works Department was responsible only for the
                  Development and Maintenance of the Public Roads and Buildings. In 1969 a major policy change was made
                  and a new Department of Highways was formed solely for the Development and Maintenance of the A, B, C,
                  D
                  and E class roads maintained by the then Department of Public Works, and the total kilometreage of
                  these
                  roads was approximately 28,000 km. <br><br>

                  However, this change was short lived, since the Territorial Civil Engineering Organisation (TCEO) was
                  formed in 1971 to take over the major functions of the Highways Department. Upto 1970 the Highways
                  Department and then Public Works Department had fully fledged Bridges Division which undertook the
                  design and construction of all major bridges in the country. However, with the formation of the TCEO
                  another organisation known as State Development and Construction Corporation (SD & CC) was formed to
                  undertake the construction of bridges and other civil engineering works. The functions of TCEO
                  included
                  maintenance and improvements of A, B, C, D and E class roads, maintenance and improvements of
                  Irrigation
                  Works, maintenance and improvements of village tanks, irrigation canals and providing assistance to
                  local authorities for road & bridge improvement works on local authority roads. Although, the Highways
                  Department also functioned during this period, its functions were reduced to planning, design of major
                  roads and bridges and construction supervision of major road and bridge works. <br><br>

                  Another major re-organisation of the Highways Sector was effected in 1978 when the TCEO was abolished
                  and functions of the TCEO transferred back to the Highways Department. In 1983 the Road Development
                  Authority (RDA) was formed under the Ministry of Highways incorporated by the RDA Act No 73 of 1981.
                  The
                  functions of RDA at its inception were confined to the execution of selected construction works.
                  <br><br>

                  The functions of the RDA were expanded in 1986, when it became the successor to the then Department of
                  Highways. In 1986, the RDA was entrusted with the responsibility of developing and maintaining all
                  classified roads in the country (A,B,C,D and E class roads) totalling upto approximately 28,000 kms of
                  roads and the bridges thereon. In 1989 with the devolution of power under the 13th amendment to the
                  constitution, the C, D and E class roads totalling approximately 17,000 kms and the bridges thereon
                  were
                  handed over to the Provincial Councils. <br><br>

                  Currently the road network of Sri Lanka is divided into three categories as National Roads, Provincial
                  Roads and roads governed by Local Authorities. The RDA also takes over roads that belong to the
                  Provincial Councils and Local Authorities and enlist them into the National Road Network. <br><br>

                  The National Road Network consists of 12,210.36 km of Trunk (A class) and Main (B class) roads, 169.13
                  km of Expressways and about 4,662 bridges (span of more than 3m) as at January 2018. Road Development
                  Authority is respobnsible for maintenance and development of the National Road Network and planning,
                  design and construction of new highways, bridges and expressways to augment the existing road network.

                      with specialized skills in Highway and Bridge Planning,
                      Design, Construction, Maintenance and Highway Safety.
                      The organizational structure is designed to carry out
                      the functions assigned to the
                      RDA and to achieve its goals and objectives.
                    </p>
                    <p>The RDA organization under the Board of management has the
                      Director General as the Chief Executive Officer. The Director
                      General is assisted by 5 Additional Director Generals and 18 D

                <p>The functions performed by the RDA consist mainly of the maintenance and development of the roads and
                  bridges in the National Highway Network and the planning, design and construction
                  of new highways, bridges and expressways to augment the existing network.</p>
                <p>The RDA has a responsibility for the development of
                  the road network to cater for the on-going overall development
                  programme of the country. Since, Road Transport is the primary mode of
                  transport in the country, it is very vital that road network is adequate
                  to developed to promote efficient transport of people and goods. The RDA
                  has a responsibility to plan the future road network taking into consideration
                  the future travel demand and formulating project proposals to meet this demand.</p>
                <p>The RDA being the Principal Highway Authority has a responsibility to provide a
                  road network to meet the social aspirations of the people in terms of mobility and
                  safety. Since, the people at large depend on public transport for their travel needs
                  it is the responsibility of the RDA to maintain the road network to a reasonable
                  standard so that there would be un-interrupted public transport available to them.</p>
                <p>Since, the rehabilitation and development of the road network is
                  undertaken with public funds at a very high cost, it is responsibility
                  of the RDA to ensure that the adequate economic returns are achieved from
                  the investments made on highway improvements. This is achieved by carrying
                  out feasibility studies before major
                  projects are undertaken and followed by post evaluation of these projects after completion.</p>

                    Under the provincial set up of the RDA, there are 10 Provincial
                    Directors reporting to Director Maintenance Management.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the Eastern Province has been divided into two regions, there are two Provincial Directors
                    in that Province, one in Batticaloa and the other in Akkaraipattu.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Under each
                    Provincial Director, there is a Chief Engineer for each District and an Executive
                    Engineer for each division. The Provincial Directors, Chief Engineers and Executive
                    Engineers are supported by
                    a number of other Engineers and Technical staff appointed on the basis of the workload.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Most of the foreign funded projects are handled by the respective
                    Project Management Units (PMUs), and they are functioning as independent
                    PMUs under the Ministry of Higher Education & Highways.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    These PMU’s maintain independent accounting units, responsible to the
                    Ministry of Higher Education & Highways and to Road Development Authority.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the RDA level, the activities of those projects are coordinated by the
                    Additional Director General (Projects).
